This project is functioning as my introduction to Unity as well as model rigging with Blender. I am trying to keep the game simple by having it an infinite runner.

I eventually want to work on a more story driven game in Unity but felt that this infinite runner will function as a better interduction to the software.",

We were allowed to choose are own ideas for this research project and I picked a PDF payload injection because I found it very interesting how something like a PDF which is opened and downloaded by everyone online can be harmful to a computer. Of course the simple injection I did would never work against any modern PDF reader, it is alarming to think that such an attack was possible back when Windows XP was the best available OS.",

I was also in charge of implementing an AI to play the player in the game of Othello. This functioned as my introduction to AI programming and I chose to go for a decision tree approach by calculating a value for every possible move the AI can make, with the value being based on how many of the players pieces the AI can convert as well as how open the move leaves my AI to future attacks by the user. After this is picks the move with the highest value and acts accordingly.",
